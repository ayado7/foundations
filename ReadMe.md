#Project Description:
Did Not Ask is an anonymous sharing platform for you to share stories that happened to you or you've been through such as abuse, marginalization, mistreatment, forced displacement, or unfairness as examples, and extends to any situation which you "Did not ask for". The problem is that it's often hard to share these stories with the public, or even our close friends, at the same time, many of us are unaware of what others are going through in their daily lives. This platform gives you space to share such stories safely, raise awareness about such topics, and have an insight into what other people are going through so you know you're not alone, and you have more sympathy towards other people in your life.

#This repository 
contains all the components that make up the "Did not Ask" website:
- the **Frontend** allows the client to interact with the application and gives them the opportunity to view existing posts from all other users
- the **Backene** connects the frontend to the database to process user requests such as storing post contents provided by the user or retrieving their posts or comments when necessary
- the **Database** stores and manages all the data of the user and posts. The user is able to delete their own records from the database  *This Database is not secure and should be used only with dummy data as the information is stored in plane text*

- You can access the deployed site through the URL: https://www.hopp-in.com/ (similarly, you can access it through the deployment URL https://foundationsproject.onrender.com/)
