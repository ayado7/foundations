Project walk-through: 
This project allows you to sign up with your own username and password, stores them both in a database, and allows you to sign in later using the same credits.
Please note: 
- The database is not secure and you should use a fake password for a test at all times
- If you'd like to sign in using an existing user you can do so with (Tester, Pass) or simply (zz, zz)
After you're signed in, you can use the input form on the website and write some input, that would be stored in the database and render a new post directly on the HTML.

The project is still missing critical functions such as a Load Main function that retreves all posts stored in the database and desplay them on the main page for all users to be able to access, and a link to each post for its own post page.

Due to some Git challenges, there is another repository of this project (https://github.com/ayado7/FP) which is linked to the online site (http://34.107.19.83/) and some minor discripancies might occur during the development.


Project Description:
Did Not Ask is an anonymous sharing platform for you to share stories that happened to you or you've been through such as abuse, marginalization, mistreatment, forced displacement, or unfairness as examples, and extends to any situation which you "Did not ask for". The problem is that it's often hard to share these stories with the public, or even our close friends, at the same time, many of us are unaware of what others are going through in their daily lives. This platform gives you space to share such stories safely, raise awareness about such topics, and have an insight into what other people are going through so you know you're not alone, and you have more sympathy towards other people in your life.
